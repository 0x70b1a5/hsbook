		Exercises: Understanding Folds
		1. foldr (*) 1 [1..5]
		will return the same result as which of the following:
		a) flip (*) 1 [1..5]
		b) foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..5]
		c) foldl (*) 1 [1..5]
b & c
		2. Write out the evaluation steps for
		foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..3]
(1 * 1) * 
        (2 * 1) * 
                (3 * 1)
		3. One difference between foldr and foldl is:
		a) foldr, but not foldl, traverses the spine of a list from
		right to left
		b) foldr, but not foldl, always forces the rest of the fold
		c) foldr, but not foldl, associates to the right
		d) foldr, but not foldl, is recursive
c
		4. Folds are catamorphisms, which means they are generally
		used to
		a) reduce structure
		b) expand structure
		c) render you catatonic
		d) generate infinite data structures
a
		5. The following are simple folds very similar to what you’ve
		already seen, but each has at least one error. Please fix
		them and test in your REPL:
		a) foldr (++) ["woot", "WOOT", "woot"]
foldr (++) "wut" [...
		b) foldr max [] "fear is the little death"
foldr max 'a' "f...
		c) foldr and True [False, True]
foldr (&&) True [...
		d) This one is more subtle than the previous. Can it ever
		return a different answer?
		foldr (||) True [False, True]
no, || stops at first True argument
		e) foldl ((++) . show) "" [1..5]
foldl (flip ((++) . show)) "...
		f ) foldr const 'a' [1..5]
foldr (flip const) '...
		g) foldr const 0 "tacos"
foldr (flip const) 0...
		h) foldl (flip const) 0 "burritos"
foldl const ...
		i) foldl (flip const) 'z' [1..5]
foldl const ...

		10.10 Chapter Exercises
		Warm-up and review
		For the following set of exercises, you are not expected to use
		folds. These are intended to review material from previous
		chapters. Feel free to use any syntax or structure from previous
		chapters that seems appropriate.
		1. Given the following sets of consonants and vowels:
		stops = "pbtdkg"
		vowels = "aeiou"
		a) Write a function that takes inputs from stops and
		vowels and makes 3-tuples of all possible stop-vowelstop
		combinations. These will not all correspond to
		real words in English, although the stop-vowel-stop
		pattern is common enough that many of them will.
-}
stops = "pbtdkg"
vowels = "aeiou"

sounds = [[x, y, z] | x <- stops, y <- vowels, z <- stops]
{-
		b) Modify that function so that it only returns the combinations
		that begin with a p.
-}
pounds = [['p', y, z] | y <- vowels, z <- stops]
{-
		c) Now set up lists of nouns and verbs (instead of stops
		and vowels) and modify the function to make tuples
		representing possible noun-verb-noun sentences.
-}
-- I would rather not
{-
		2. What does the following mystery function do? What is
		its type? Try to get a good sense of what it does before
		you test it in the REPL to verify it.
-}
seekritFunc x =
	div (sum (map length (words x)))
		(length (words x))
-- It returns the average length of the words in a sentence

{-
		3. We’d really like the answer to be more precise. Can you
		rewrite that using fractional division?	
-}
seekritFunc2 x =
    (fromIntegral (sum (map length (words x))))
    / (fromIntegral (length (words x)))

{-
		Rewriting functions using folds
		In the previous chapter, you wrote these functions using direct
		recursion over lists. The goal now is to rewrite them using
		folds. Where possible, to gain a deeper understanding of
		folding, try rewriting the fold version so that it is point-free.
		Point-free versions of these functions written with a fold
		should look like:
		myFunc = foldr f z
		So for example with the and function:
		-- Again, this type will be less reusable than
		-- the one in GHC 7.10 and newer. Don't worry.
		-- direct recursion, not using (&&)
		myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
		myAnd [] = True
		myAnd (x:xs) =
		if x == False
		then False
		else myAnd xs
		-- direct recursion, using (&&)
		myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
		myAnd [] = True
		myAnd (x:xs) = x && myAnd xs
		-- fold, not point-free in the folding function
		myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
		myAnd = foldr
		(\a b ->
		if a == False
		then False
		else b) True
		-- fold, both myAnd and the folding function are point-free now
		myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
		myAnd = foldr (&&) True
		The goal here is to converge on the final version where
		possible. You don’t need to write all variations for each example,
		but the more variations you write, the deeper your
		understanding of these functions will become.

		3. Write two versions of myElem. One version should use
